- [x] Implement ethical compliance with robots.txt for all sources
- [x] Test and validate scraping functionality
- [x] Implement duplicate checking based on source URL
- [x] Implement date parsing and standardization
- [x] Expose scraping via a "GO" button in the UI

## 3. AI/NLP Categorization Module
- [x] Define categories: Money Laundering, Fraud, Gambling, Corruption, Tax Evasion, Other/Uncategorized
- [x] Integrate spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers for text classification
- [x] Implement logic to assign one primary category per article

## 4. Data Persistence Module
- [x] Design CSV schema: title, url, source_name, publication_date, category, full_text
- [x] Implement logic to append new, unique articles to CSV
- [x] Implement duplicate checking based on URL
- [x] Ensure all analysis/reporting reads from the CSV file in `/output`
- [x] Test and validate CSV operations
- [x] Implement statistics and data analysis functionality
- [x] **NEW**: Implement dual file output - session-specific CSV + process log with datetime tracking

## 5. User Interface (UI)
- [x] Build simple UI with Streamlit or Gradio
- [x] Add "GO" button (changed from "Refresh") to trigger scraping and update CSV
- [x] Display status messages (e.g., number of new articles found, errors)
- [x] Display current database statistics
- [x] Display recent articles table
- [x] Add CSV download functionality

## 6. Testing & Validation
- [x] Test scraping for each news source
- [x] Test keyword filtering and duplicate detection
- [x] Test CSV output format and data integrity
- [x] Test AI categorization accuracy
- [x] Validate duplicate checking functionality

## 7. Documentation
- [x] Update README with setup, usage, and troubleshooting instructions
- [x] Document code with comments and docstrings
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite for validation

# Testing Requirements for AML News Analysis System
# Additional dependencies needed for running unit tests

# Core testing framework (usually included with Python)
# unittest - built-in, no installation needed

# For enhanced testing capabilities (optional)
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
pytest-mock>=3.10.0

# For test data generation and mocking (if needed)
factory-boy>=3.2.0
faker>=18.0.0

# For performance testing
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0

# For parallel test execution
pytest-xdist>=3.0.0

# Note: The unit tests are designed to work with Python's built-in unittest module
# and don't strictly require pytest, but pytest provides additional features
# like better output formatting and parallel execution.

# Development Log - Project & Team Management Features

## Version 2.1 - AI Analysis Enhancement with Model Information

### Overview
Enhanced the AI analysis system to display detailed information about which AI model was used for analysis, providing transparency to users about the analysis source.

### AI Analysis Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced API Response Structure
**File**: `app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`
**Date**: Current Implementation

Updated the AI analysis API to return comprehensive information:
```typescript
// New response structure
{
  insights: string,
  source: 'gemini' | 'local',
  model: string // e.g., 'gemini-1.5-flash', 'gemini-1.5-pro', 'gemini-pro', 'manual-logic'
}
```

#### 2. Multiple Gemini Model Support
**File**: `app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`

Enhanced model fallback system with multiple API versions:
```typescript
const modelConfigs = [
  { model: 'gemini-1.5-flash', apiVersion: 'v1beta' },
  { model: 'gemini-1.5-pro', apiVersion: 'v1beta' },
  { model: 'gemini-pro', apiVersion: 'v1' }
];
```

#### 3. UI Enhancement for Model Information
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/timesheet/dashboard/page.tsx`

Added model information display:
- **Header Badge**: Shows "Gemini AI (model-name)" or "Manual Logic"
- **Insight Label**: Displays "Powered by model-name" or "Manual Analysis"
- **State Management**: Added `analysisModel` state to track current model

#### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly which AI model was used
- **Fallback Visibility**: Clear indication when manual logic is used
- **Model-Specific Badges**: Different styling for Gemini vs Manual analysis

### Technical Implementation Details

#### API Response Handling
```typescript
// Updated response handling
if (response.ok) {
  const data = await response.json();
  setAiInsights(data.insights);
  setAnalysisSource(data.source || 'local');
  setAnalysisModel(data.model || 'manual-logic');
}
```

#### UI Display Logic
```typescript
// Header badge with model information
{analysisSource === 'gemini' && (
  <span className="text-xs bg-green-100 text-green-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">
    Gemini AI ({analysisModel})
  </span>
)}

// Insight label with model information
<span className="text-xs text-gray-500">
  {analysisSource === 'gemini' ? `Powered by ${analysisModel}` : 'Manual Analysis'}
</span>
```

## Version 3.0 - Role-Based Access Control & Team Management

### Overview
This update implements a comprehensive role-based access control system with proper user roles, team creation flow, and restricted access based on team membership.

### Database Schema Changes

#### 1. Updated User Role Default
**File**: `lib/db/schema.ts`
**Migration**: `lib/db/migrations/0005_warm_leopardon.sql`

Changed default user role from 'member' to 'user':
```sql
ALTER TABLE "users" ALTER COLUMN "role" SET DEFAULT 'user';
```

#### 2. Updated Seed Data
**File**: `lib/db/seed.ts`

Changed seed user role from 'admin' to 'user':
```typescript
role: "user", // Previously "admin"
```

### User Registration & Team Management Flow

**File**: `app/(login)/actions.ts`

**New Flow**:
- Users register as 'user' by default
- Standalone users (no team) can create teams to become owners
- Users with invitations join teams with specified roles
- No automatic team creation for new registrations

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
const newUser: NewUser = {
  email,
  passwordHash,
  role: 'user' // Default role, will be overridden if there's an invitation
};

// User registers without invitation - they become a standalone user
if (!inviteId) {
  await logActivity(null, createdUser.id, ActivityType.SIGN_UP);
  await setSession(createdUser);
  redirect('/dashboard');
}
```

#### 2. New Team Creation Action
**File**: `app/(login)/actions.ts`

Added `createTeam` server action:
```typescript
export const createTeam = validatedActionWithUser(
  createTeamSchema,
  async (data, _, user) => {
    // Check if user is already part of a team
    // Create new team
    // Add user as owner of the team
    // Log activity
  }
);

if (userTeamRole[0].role !== 'owner') {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Only team owners can create projects' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Standalone User | Team Member | Team Owner |
